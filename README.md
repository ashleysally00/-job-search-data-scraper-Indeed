# Job Search Data Scraper

## Project Overview
A Python-based job search data extraction tool that demonstrates web scraping, data processing, and CSV file handling for jobs on Indeed.

## Process Overview

### 1. URL Generation
- Takes position and location parameters
- Formats them for URL compatibility
- Creates properly structured URLs for job searches

### 2. Data Extraction
- Implements robust error handling with try/except blocks
- Extracts key job information (title, company, location, salary, description)
- Handles missing data gracefully

### 3. Main Program Flow
- Manages the complete scraping process
- Handles HTTP requests with appropriate headers
- Processes multiple job postings
- Saves data to CSV format

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Web Scraping Limitations
- Challenge: Indeed's anti-scraping measures blocked direct scraping
- Solution: Implemented a sample data version to demonstrate functionality
- Learning: Understanding real-world API limitations and alternative approaches

### Error Handling
- Implemented comprehensive try/except blocks
- Ensured program stability with missing data
- Created default values for missing fields

## Future Improvements
- Implement Indeed's official API integration
- Add support for multiple job boards
- Include pagination for multiple result pages
- Add data cleaning and deduplication
- Create visualization of job market trends
- Add email notifications for new postings
